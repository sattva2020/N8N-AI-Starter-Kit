## Documentation

We've also improved the documentation:

1. Created `SETUP_SCRIPT_IMPROVEMENTS.md` with detailed information about script enhancements
2. Created `ENHANCED_FEATURES.md` with comprehensive feature explanations
3. Added a section to the README.md about the script improvements
4. Added troubleshooting guidance for common scenarios

## Usage

The improved setup script provides a seamless installation experience across multiple platforms while ensuring system compatibility and providing helpful guidance throughout the process. It's designed to make N8N AI Starter Kit accessible to users with various technical backgrounds.

```bash
# Run the enhanced setup script
bash scripts/setup.sh
```

## Future Improvements

Some potential areas for future enhancement:

1. Add Windows-native support (PowerShell version)
2. Include automated testing of installation steps
3. Add more language options for script output
4. Integrate a web-based setup wizard option
5. Add support for container orchestration platforms (e.g., Kubernetes)
