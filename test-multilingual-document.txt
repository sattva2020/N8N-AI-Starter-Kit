Advanced AI Machine Learning and Semantic Search Testing Document

This document contains information about artificial intelligence, machine learning algorithms, and semantic search capabilities. The Advanced RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) Pipeline demonstrates sophisticated natural language processing and vector database integration.

Key features include:
- Semantic similarity search using sentence transformers
- Vector embeddings with Qdrant database
- Multi-language support (English and Russian)
- Real-time document processing and indexing
- Web-based interface for document management

Этот документ также содержит русский текст для тестирования многоязычных возможностей. 

The system uses state-of-the-art transformer models for creating high-quality embeddings that capture semantic meaning across different languages and contexts.

Testing scenarios:
1. Upload and processing documents
2. Semantic search with various queries  
3. Similarity scoring and ranking
4. Cross-language retrieval capabilities
5. Performance and response time optimization

Machine learning pipeline includes sentence transformers, embedding generation, vector storage, and similarity computation for comprehensive information retrieval.
